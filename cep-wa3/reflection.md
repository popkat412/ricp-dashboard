## Design decisions

I talked quite extensively about design decisions in my devlog so I won't repeat
them here. Go check out the devlog for more info :D

## What I have learnt

I learnt that planning is extremely important, but no matter how long you spend
planning and theory crafting, there will always be mistakes in your plan and
unexpecetd things will happen. You have to learn to adapt. This is very evient
from my experience with how the data was strucutred in Firestore, with the whole
UI not updating bug and everything (again, go read hte devlog first).

## What I am proude of

Honestly? Not much. As with most coding projects I do, whenever I look back, I
feel like, "damn, I could have done this so much faster. did it really take me
two whole months just to do _this_?". However, this is another thing that I have
to realise, which is that it took a lot of trial and error to get here, and its
these backtracking and fixing old mistakes that take up time. Some senior from
SYPT (Singapore Young Physicists' Tournament, a physics research competition)
says that if they had known the correct approach right from the start, their
entire research journey would have only taken a week, but instead they took
several months. I guess through this trial and error process, I learnt a lot, so
the next time, I shouldn't make the same mistakes again. Damn, this just turned
into a "What I have learnt" xD.
